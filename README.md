# portfolio_db - naveen

This repository contains the **structured JSON data** used to power my dynamic portfolio and resume site. It helps me manage personal information, projects, work experience, certifications, and tech stack directly from GitHub — without needing a backend or CMS.

It helps me manage:

- Personal details
- Tech stack
- Projects (all + highlights)
- Certifications
- Work experience

## Why I Use This

- ✅ Easy to update content (just push JSON)
- ✅ GitHub acts as a lightweight database
- ✅ Keeps frontend clean and focused on UI
- ✅ Works well with Cloudinary for images/videos
- ✅ NO need to rebuild the app every time
