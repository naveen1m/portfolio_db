    "bio": "I’m a B.Tech graduate in Computer Science & IT with a passion for building intelligent, scalable, and user-focused digital products. What began as a curiosity for how systems work soon evolved into a deep-rooted drive to build purposeful technology. Over the years, I’ve built 50+ personal projects, delivered freelance solutions for real clients, and gained practical experience through internships — turning ideas into fully functional, real-world applications. With 60+ projects under my belt — spanning personal builds, hackathons, internships, and freelance work — I’ve created full-stack web applications, Android apps, and AI-powered systems using machine learning and deep learning, reflecting both depth and versatility. Along the way, I’ve published research, built real-world projects, and continuously explored the deeper layers of software development and machine learning. I remain driven by a single goal: to create technology that not only works, but learns, scales, and leaves a lasting impact.",
