    "desc": "Developed a Software Development Kit (SDK) to enable seamless translation across 22+ Indian languages, leveraging the Bhashini API for robust and scalable multilingual support. Selected as the sole developer for the project and successfully delivered it two weeks ahead of the 8-week timeline. Utilized JavaScript for core development, Postman for API testing, and jsDoc for detailed technical documentation and developer usability. The SDK aimed to enhance accessibility for Indian language applications and streamline integration for client platforms.",

    "desc": "Developed a real-time number plate recognition system for closed campus areas such as malls, colleges, and residential societies, addressing challenges like partial occlusion and low-light conditions. Utilized YOLOv11n for accurate detection of number plates even when partially blocked, and integrated EasyOCR for robust character recognition from unclear or incomplete text. Implemented a smart matching mechanism to reconstruct full plate numbers from multiple partial detections. The system significantly enhances recognition accuracy and reliability, making it suitable for secure, real-time applications.",
